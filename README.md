# Simple Champion and Skin Viewer
An app made with Nuxt3 and Vue that displays information gathered from Riot's Data Dragon API. The app was made with the intention of learning Vue and was eventually taken to Nuxt.

More information on how I felt and what I learned is within the website.

To run it yourself, just clone the repository and run

```
npm run dev
```
